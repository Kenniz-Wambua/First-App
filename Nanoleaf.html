<font face = "Comic Sans MS" size = "4"><p> For a futuristic kind of home decor, 
ake a look at these customizable light panels from Nanoleaf. Connect a string of them into whatever design 
you'd like on your wall, then control them from the app. The color options are vast, as are the modesâ€”set the 
light panels to react to your music playlist, assist with your concentration, or mimic a rising sun in the morning
 to wake you up. You can buy triangular panels now, but if you wait until the end of the year, Nanoleaf is adding hexagonal panels as well. 
 A starter kit of this retails for about 200 USD</br>
