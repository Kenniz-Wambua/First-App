<font face = "Comic Sans MS" size = "4"><p> Believe me when we say we weren't expecting 
Facebook's Oculus Quest to be one of our top gadgets of 2019. The VR headset blew me away 
when it being introduced at CES and then again when i got to watch review of famous youtubers in the tech space play an extensive library of immersive 
VR games (like Beatsaber and Super Hot) when it launched in the spring. Quest isn't a breakthrough for
VR simply because it doesn't require a beefy PC or smartphone or external sensors to track your head and 
hand movements. It's a new milestone for VR because it's actually fun to play with. The same can't be said for pretty much all other VR headsets. 
You can snag this for 399 USD</br>
