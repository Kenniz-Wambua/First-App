<font face = "Comic Sans MS" size = "4"><p> The Huawei P30 Pro (899 GBP) offers the holy trinity of superb design, screen and camera with 
no less than four versatile cameras, a fast in-display fingerprint sensor and an all-screen, small notch design. 
It's so well specced and easy to live with, it's our new WIRED Recommends pick for best smartphone.</br>
Buying advice on Huawei: After Huawei was placed on a US government blacklist, Google has revoked Huawei's Android license - 
though there is a temporary license for security updates - chip designer ARM has announced it won't sell to the company 
and Facebook has blocked Huawei from pre-installing its app on Huawei phones. We'd therefore advise caution before buying 
Huawei products right now, though the situation regarding security and a US-China trade war is developing.</br>
