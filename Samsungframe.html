<font face = "Comic Sans MS" size = "4"><p> When you aren't watching TV, the Frame displays 
high-def paintings and pictures so that wall space isn't wasted. 
It's definitely a classy take on a 4K TV-watching experience. Furthermore Samsung have updated its Frame TV
 to QLED quality for 2019. This year, Samsung also beefed up its QLED 8K line to include 65-, 75-, and 82-inch screens, 
 which you can shop now on Amazon if you have a bundle of cash to blow.</br>
